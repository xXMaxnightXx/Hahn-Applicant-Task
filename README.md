## Getting Started

1. run `nuget restore` on solution projects
2. run `cd Hahn.ApplicatonProcess.December2020.Web\frontend` then run `npm install`
3. to run applications you have two options:
    - using proxy server and run front-end and back-end seperately
    -  using built-in `aurelia-cli` inside the project and let the aspnet core handle it.
  
  options mentioned above can be found in `startup.cs` in Web Application Project.
